    <h2>What Are Confidential Funds?</h2>
    <p>
        Confidential funds are portions of the government budget used for sensitive operations,
        such as intelligence gathering, security work, or investigations that cannot be fully
        disclosed to the public. Because details about these expenses are limited, strict 
        accountability and responsible use are essential.
    </p>

    <p>
        Understanding what confidential funds are—and how they should be managed—helps citizens
        recognize when these resources are being used correctly or abused for personal or political gain.
