    <h2>Laws and Agencies Fighting Corruption</h2>
    <p>
        The Philippines has several laws that protect public funds and ensure accountability.
        One of the most important is the <strong>Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act</strong>,
        which outlines offenses related to bribery, misuse of money, and abuse of power.
    </p>

    <p>
        Agencies such as the <strong>Commission on Audit (COA)</strong> review government spending,  
        while the <strong>Office of the Ombudsman</strong> investigates public officials accused
        of wrongdoing. These systems exist to uphold integrity and safeguard taxpayer money.
