    <h2>Welcome to the Anti-Corruption Awareness Website</h2>
    <p>
        Corruption affects the progress and well-being of communities throughout the Philippines,
        including Zambales. One major concern is the misuse of confidential funds—government money
        that cannot be fully disclosed to the public. When these funds are mismanaged, it weakens
        trust and slows down development.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website provides clear and accessible information to help citizens understand how public
        funds should be protected and used. By staying informed, the people of Zambales can support
        transparency, accountability, and responsible governance for the benefit of all communities.
