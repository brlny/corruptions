    <h2>How Misuse Affects Communities in Zambales</h2>
    <p>
        When confidential funds are misused, the impact is felt directly by the people of Zambales.
        Money that should support hospitals, schools, livelihood programs, and disaster response
        becomes unavailable. This slows down development and reduces the quality of public services.
    </p>

    <p>
        Proper use of funds ensures progress—better roads, improved education, reliable healthcare,
        and strong emergency preparedness. Misuse, however, delays opportunities and harms the
        welfare of local families and communities.
